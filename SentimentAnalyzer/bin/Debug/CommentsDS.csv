There is no other option like grocery and medicines. Approximately in the month of January 2021^ i placed an order at some restaurant^ after waiting for an hour^ my order was cancelled by the restaurant. As I had paid in advance an amount of Rs. 1^299/- ^ that amound was refunded to me in my wallet. As now there are no options of grocery or medicine^ i dont know how to get my money back. I dont want to try food any more.,1,12,3.12.4,8/7/2021 12:18,Hey Adnan. Please accept our sincere apologies. Please note that the delivery services are available in Lahore only.
